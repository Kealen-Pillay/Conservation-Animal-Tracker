# Conservation Animal Tracker

This software represents a system that is intended to aid in research and conservation efforts towards animals and
endangered species. The real-world application of this system would be seen in wildlife reserves, animal sanctuaries,
and remote regions. The system would be integrated with drones so that they could cover a plain of space while
detecting, tracking, and monitoring animals.

The system would be able to detect animals in real-time while asynchonrously logging animal sightings and
classifications to remote logs so that they could be viewed at a later time. In this way the system could be assiged a
region and a period of time, and the researcher or conservationist could view the results in real-time or at a more
convenient time. This would allow for safer and less-intrusive tracking, monitoring and observation.

For the context of this assignment, the system has been simulated using a Raspberry PI + camera module.
